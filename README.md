# Cloud DevOps Question 
```
1. What are your daily responsibilities as a DevOps engineer?
- [] Have you worked with monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack?
- [] Can you describe the CI/CD workflow in your project?
4. How do you handle the continuous delivery (CD) aspect in your projects?
5. What methods do you use to check for code vulnerabilities?
6. What AWS services are you proficient in
7. How would you access data in an S3 bucket from Account A when your application is running on an EC2 instance in Account B?
8. How do containerisation technologies like Docker and Kubernetes simplify application deployment and management?

8. How do you provide access to an S3 bucket, and what permissions need to be set on the bucket side?
9. How can Instance 2, with a static IP, communicate with Instance 1, which is in a private subnet and mapped to a multi-AZ load balancer?
10. For an EC2 instance in a private subnet, how can it verify and download required packages from the internet without using a NAT gateway or bastion host? Are there any other AWS services that can facilitate this?
11. What is the typical latency for a load balancer, and if you encounter high latency, what monitoring steps would you take?
12. If your application is hosted in S3 and users are in different geographic locations, how can you reduce latency?
13. Can you share an example of a complex automation script you've written?
14. How do you approach troubleshooting and debugging automation scripts?

15. Which services can be integrated with a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
16. How do you dynamically retrieve VPC details from AWS to create an EC2 instance using IaC, can you write the code?
17. How do you manage unmanaged AWS resources in Terraform?
16. How do you pass arguments to a VPC while using the `terraform import` command?
18. What are the prerequisites before importing a VPC in Terraform?
19. If an S3 bucket was created through Terraform but someone manually added a policy to it, how do you handle this situation using IaC?
20. Have you upgraded any Kubernetes clusters?
21. How do you deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster?
22. How do you communicate with a Jenkins server and a Kubernetes cluster?
23. Do you only update Docker images in Kubernetes, or do you also update replicas, storage levels, and CPU allocation?
